    <p>
      Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's
      ground-floor studio,it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was
      painted from memory. The view has been identified as the one from his
      bedroom window, facing east,a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no
      fewer than twenty-one times, including The Starry Night."Through the
      iron-barred window," he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889,"I
      can see an enclosed square of wheat ... above which, in the morning, I
      watch the sun rise in all its glory."
