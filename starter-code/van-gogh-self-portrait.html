    <h1>1889</h1>
    <p>
      This self-portrait was one of about 32 produced over a 10-year period, and
      these were an important part of his work as a painter; he painted himself
      because he often lacked the money to pay for models. He took the painting
      with him to Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, where he showed it to Dr. Paul
      Gachet, who thought it was "absolutely fanatical". Art historians are
      divided as to whether this painting or Self-portrait without beard is Van
      Gogh's final self-portrait. The art historians Ingo F. Walther and Jan
      Hulsker consider this to be the last.
