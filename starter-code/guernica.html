  The scene occurs within a room where, on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands over 
  a grieving woman holding a dead child in her arms. In the center of the room a 
  horse falls in agony with a large gaping hole in its side, as if it had just been 
  run through by a spear or javelin. The horse appears to be wearing chain mail 
  armor, decorated with vertical tally marks arranged in rows. A dead and dismembered 
  soldier lies under the horse. The hand of his severed right arm grasps a shattered 
  sword, from which a flower grows.
